# Merge Rewards

Rewarding Social Development

## Build Setup

To run Merge Rewards locally you need at least a [Steem account](https://signup.steemit.com) that acts as Merge Rewards and a [GitHub app](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to connect to your GitHub account. If you want to do anything related to payments via PayPal you'll need a [PayPal app](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout) as well.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the vairables then run the following commands.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

This project is built with the [Nuxt.js framework](https://nuxtjs.org).
