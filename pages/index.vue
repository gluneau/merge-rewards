            Contribute to other people's Open Source projects on GitHub. Your
            contributions can be anything, from developing new features to
            fixing typos in a project's documentation.<br />
            <br />
            As long as there's a pull request that the project owner decided to
            merge into his/her project, you'll be able to claim your rewards by
            just clicking a button.

            Your pull requests are scored by a
            <b>transparent algorithm</b> which is constantly improved by the
            community, to prevent abuse and to distribute rewards in a most fair
            way.<br />
            <br />
            On top of that, every member of the community can affect your reward
            by simply voting for it. The weight of these votes is based on how
            much a person already contributed to other projects.

            Your rewards will be generated in STEEM and then converted to your
            favorite currency. STEEM is a decentralized content network as well
            as a digital currency to reward creators of good content. The
            intrinsic value of STEEM lies in its possibility to be used as
            influence on how rewards are distributed.<br />
            <br />
            Merge Rewards considers your merged pull requests as "good content"
            and uses its influence to distribute STEEM tokens to you, which you
            can then use to buy goods and services from other STEEM users,
            exchange it for "real money", like USD or Euro or to gain more
            influence in the voting process yourself.
